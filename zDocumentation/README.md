zDocumentation, or RTFD!

A vDocumentation module aimed at documenting Zerto environments. Early versions depended on Powershell core but Lee and Ken showed us a way to interact with REST through PowerCLI and this eases installation and portability :)

Version 1.0 aims to fill the model excel file in this folder.
